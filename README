  First of all, you need to dig into config.h, and ensure that the settings meet your needs.
MAGIC_DIR should be changed to the name of the directory you want to hide from the system. This can
be used as a prefix to your main directory as well as for files. MAGIC_GID will be the Group ID to
hide as well. Make sure that you set MAGIC_DIR Group ID to MAGIC_GID for hiding purposes as well.
This will help disguise the processes from the system, including commands like ps.
